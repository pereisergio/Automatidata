Project goal: 

In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.

Background: 

Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.

Scenario:

You have received notice that the recently submitted New York City TLC project proposal has been approved. The Automatidata team now has access to the New York City TLC data to analyze, identify key variables, and prepare for exploratory data analysis.

Tasks:

Load data, explore, and extract the New York City TLC data with Python

Use custom functions to organize the information within the New York City TLC dataset

Build a dataframe for the New York City TLC project

Create an executive summary for Automatidata
